            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>The Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during the summer due to the expansion of the iron in the heat.</li>
                <li>Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, berries are defined as fleshy fruits produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this 
                    criteria.</li>
                <li>Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible.</li>
                <li>The longest recorded flight of a chicken is 13 seconds. This amusing fact highlights the limited flying abilities of domestic chickens.</li>
                <li>The world's largest desert is not the Sahara, but Antarctica. A desert is defined by its low precipitation, and Antarctica fits this criteria despite being 
                    covered in ice.</li>
                <li>Octopuses have three hearts. Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body.</li>
